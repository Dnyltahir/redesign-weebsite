<h2 class="message">MESSAGE FROM THE HOD</h2>
<p class="HOD">Our department strives to meet national and international standards of health care delivery, teaching, training and research, with special emphasis on intensive care and pain management. We aim to provide optimum perioperative care in both elective and emergency operation theatres of all specialities of mayo hospital.</p>
<h3 class="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p class="first">The Academic Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences is currently headed by Prof Dr. Aftab Asif (MRCPsych). In addition to Prof. Aftab, the Department has two full time Psychiatry faculty members and six full time clinical psychologists, one social medical officer, two registrars, post graduate residents and several medical and house officers. The Academic Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Sciences at King Edward Medical University / Mayo Hospital Lahore has an impressive history. It was founded in 1964 on an outpatient basis under Prof Muhammad Rashid Chaudhry, a former graduate of King Edward Medical College who joined as Consultant Psychiatrist in 1960. He also held the position of Medical Superintendent of Mayo Hospital from 1974-1975. He later became Professor of Department of Psychiatry in 1975-1982. He was awarded the title of Emeritus Professor of Psychiatry in 1984. Under his dynamic leadership, in 1975 the inpatient facility was added and later expanded. In 1978 UN/PAK Model Drug Abuse & Rehabilitation Centre was established. The Department was actively involved in multiple national and international research projects under his supervision.</p>
<p class="second">Professor I.A.K Tareen joined as the Head of Department of Psychiatry in 1982. Under his pioneering vision the first and largest purpose built Psychiatry Department in the country was built in 1989 having separate Adult & Adolescence, Geriatric and Addiction units. The library, laboratory, conference room, psychotherapy and occupational therapy rooms and an ECT suite were part of the structure. He worked extensively with the Government to build human resource at the Department of Psychiatry. Seats for Associate and Assistant Professor, Senior Registrar, Medical Officers, House Officers and Staff Nurses were increased. More seats for Clinical Psychologist, Medical Social Officer, Statistical Officer, Occupational Therapist, Laboratory and ECT technicians were allocated.</p>

<p class="third">Teaching Programs for Training and Research purposes involving foreign faculty members from UK, USA, Australia and other countries were a regular feature at the Department of Psychiatry. In collaboration with the Royal College of Psychiatrists Prof. Tareen established the Overseas Doctors Training Scheme. Many talented doctors went to the UK under this scheme and are now renowned consultants in the UK. The 14 bed UN/PAK Model Drug Abuse & Rehabilitation Centre was visited by Lady Diana Spencer, Princess of Wales in 1991. Professor Tareen’s mission emphasized educating students, physicians, mental health professionals and specially the general public about Psychiatry in order to remove the social stigma associated with it.</p>
<p class="fourth">Professor Dr. M. Riaz Bhatti chaired the Department of Psychiatry from 2001-2012. He organized numerous International symposia and workshops. The 9th International NeuroPsycon 2012 on Psychiatric updates and Media/Public awareness was held at King Edward Medical University. He revived the Community Outreach Program for psychiatric patients. Under this program senior doctors visited four District hospitals located in Lahore on a weekly basis.</p>

<p class="fifth">The Academic Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences is currently headed by Prof Dr. Aftab Asif (MRCPsych) who joined as Professor and Head of Department in 2012. A former graduate of King Edward Medical College, Prof. Aftab started his career under the guidance of Prof. Tareen as house officer and later Medical Officer at the Department of Psychiatry. After completing his MRCPsych from the UK, he returned to Pakistan and joined the Department as Assistant Professor of Psychiatry. Prof Dr. Aftab Asif is actively involved in improving the standard of undergraduate and postgraduate teaching and training.
